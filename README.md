NOTE: The dataset files are titled, 'Embiid.csv' and 'RegualarSeason.csv'. The project Rmd file is 'STAT 184 Final Project (1).Rmd'.

I decided to do my final project on the Philadelphia 76ers because I want to analyze the NBA team that I support. I want to do a basic analysis on whether or not a correlation exists between how our star player, Joel Embiid, does on field goal percentage in a game and the margin of victory or loss of that game. As a 76ers fan, I love watching Embiid play and I expect him to have a big game every time he plays. When his shots are going in, the team seemingly prospers. When his shots are not, the team struggles. Also, he shoots a lot every game, so it is fair to test his field goal percentage. I used the 2018-19 regular season games that Embiid has played to do this analysis. I got my data from BasketballReference, a well-known sports data site. I gathered two tables from the site. One table is the "Joel Embiid 2018-19 Game Log" and the other is the "2018-19 Philadelphia 76ers Schedule and Results". Again, I used the reguar season version of these tables. The postseason games have a different intensity and I feel the data would be skewed if I included it. I imported the tables into Rstudio and then got rid of the variables I did not need. I then joined the tables into one and used that table to create a visual representation to test the correlation.
