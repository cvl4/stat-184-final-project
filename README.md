I decided to do my final project on the Philadelphia 76ers, the NBA team that I support. I want to do a basic analysis on seeing whether or not a correlation exists between how our star player, Joel Embiid, does on field goal percentage and the margin of victory or loss. This is a good experiment because as a 76ers fan, I love watching Embiid play and I expect him to have a big game every time he plays. Also, he shoots a lot every game. I used the 2018-19 regular season games that Embiid has played to do this analysis. I got my data from BasketballReference, a well-known sports data site. I gathered two tables from the site. One site is the "Joel Embiid 2018-19 Game Log" and the other is the "2018-19 Philadelphia 76ers Schedule and Results". Again, I used the reguar season version of these tables. I imported the tables into Rstudio and then got rid of the variables I did not need. I then joined the tables into one and used that table to create a visual representation to test the correlation.
